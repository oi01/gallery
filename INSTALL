=== oi01 Gallery

--- Installation Guide

The gallery contains two parts: server and client.



--- Server

The files in the server directory is dedicated for your webserver. Simply upload these files to your server and enter the URL in your browser.

An installation site is shown that lets you change some settings. After that the initialization process is executed including the following steps:

- Creating user/pass for the tools directory. It is used to update or reset the gallery.
- Removing further installation files to protect unauthorized resets

Finally a complete update of available galleries is done, creating thumbnails of the images and writing index and tag files.

In the end your new gallery is ready to visit.



--- Client

Required tool: ImageMagick > http://www.imagemagick.org

For now only a registry file for MS Windows is available. It contains entries to add new items in the context menu of the Windows File Explorer.

IMPORTANT: PLEASE CHECK THE REGISTRY FILE BEFORE EXECUTING!!

Unfortunately Picasa relinked the class "jpegfile", so the own Google class needs to be modified. Please check your system if this is also the case.

Now you have two new items in your context menu.

"oi01.de - Gallery: Add" adds a new command in a batch file of the selected images to execute the additional tool "imagemagick".
It resizes the pictures and adds the URL oi01.de in the lower right corner. Please feel free to modify the text for your purpose.

"oi01.de - Gallery: Exe" executes the current list of commands.
